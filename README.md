# ClubManagementSystem
I built a system to manage registeration of new members and other some  functionalities the club employee just has to use a simple gui and all the transactions(member addition or deletion or update) will be updated in the mysql database.
I used my OOP knowledge in JAVA and my basic knowledge of mysql databases to build this project and 
The tough part for me in this project is how I connect my java application with the mysql database to make any operation in the database.
All the files you will see in the repository is either jaav files or fxml files 
Each java file represent a class and the fxml files are used for building the GUI.
